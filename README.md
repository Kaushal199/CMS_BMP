## Project Description
We have developed a canteen food ordering and management system based on case scenario at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute For Information And Communication Technology. This system has 3 main group of user - customer, shop owner, and admin. Customer can view shop and menu list, add item to the cart, place the order up to 1 day in advance, pay for order, and view their order history. Shop owner can edit their shop information, manage their menus, manage customer orders, and view revenue report. There's also a "admin" mode which can manage the system of customer, shop, menu, and orders.
